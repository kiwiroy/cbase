In this file are summarized the additions and modifications made to
blkio this release.  Users upgrading from a previous release should
read it carefully.


                      blkio 1.1.3 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o ANSI compatibility macros moved to dedicated header file <ansi.h>.

o Function prototype form used for function definitions if AC_PROTO
  defined.

o Additional ANSI compatibility macros added.

o bcloseall function added.

o SINGLE_USER macro added.

o nelems macro added.

o "fd" suffix removed from member names in fd_t union.

o Reference to l_sysid member of flock structure removed from lockb.c
  because not defined in BSD UNIX.

o Operating system macros changed to the form OS_*, and HOST changed
  to OPSYS.  Also, C compiler macros changed to the form CC_*, and
  MSDOSC changed to CCOM.  These macros are only used internally, and
  the changes are only of interest to users who have ported blkio to
  a new operating system or compiler.

o DOS file locking added to lockb.

o DOS library names changed to more customary form where memory model
  is first character rather than last.


                      blkio 1.1.2 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o __STDC__ macro no longer used to detect ansi compatibility.

o AC_HDRS macro added to indicate availability of all ANSI headers
  (e.g., <stddef.h> and <stdlib.h>).


                                                     Citadel  91/09/23
o AC_LDOUBLE macro changed to function as flag indicating long double
  data type support.

o AC_PROTO macro added to indicate function prototype support.

o lockb bug fixed.

o Memory model parameter added to install.bat.  Library file name
  changed to signify model (e.g., blkioh.lib for huge).

o Parameter added to install.bat to make extraction of reference
  manual optional.


                      blkio 1.1.1 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o NIL macro added in blkio.h.

o #define void char added in blkio.h if __STDC__ != 1.  This is for
  older compilers which do not recognize the void type.

o strlen declaration if __STDC__ != 1 removed.


o The macros FILENAME_MAX, FOPEN_MAX, and offsetof are checked to be
  defined even if __STDC__ == 1.

o -A compiler option used in Turbo C installation bat file to set
  __STDC__ to 1.

o MSDOS macro in blkio_.h changed to MS_DOS to prevent QuickC
  warnings.

o For UNIX, errno values EFBIG and ENOSPC used when appropriate rather
  than BEPANIC.


                       blkio 1.1 Release Notes
                       -----------------------
o bpos_t typedef changed from size_t to unsigned long.  If using a
  compiler that defines size_t as unsigned int and sizeof(int) !=
  sizeof(long), this allows larger files to be accessed, but will
  cause problems with existing files created with blkio 1.0.  Existing
  files will require conversion if sizeof(int) != sizeof(long) for the
  compiler being used.  If the limitation on the number of records is
  unimportant, the bpos_t typedef (in blkio.h) can be changed back to
  size_t so that no file conversion will be necessary.

o bopen has been modified to open block files which do not end on a
  block boundary.  This was done to allow blkio to be used to rebuild
  corrupt files.
                                                     Citadel  91/09/23

o bsetvbuf bug for connecting user-supplied buffer fixed.

o function prototypes used if __STDC__ == 1

o const used if __STDC__ == 1

o bgethf sets errno to EINVAL instead of BEBOUND if the field extends
  beyond the end of the header.

o bgetbf sets errno to EINVAL instead of BEBOUND if the field extends
  beyond the end of the block.

o lockb len parameter type changed from size_t to bpos_t.
