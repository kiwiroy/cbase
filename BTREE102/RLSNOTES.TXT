In this file are summarized the additions and modifications made to
btree this release.  Users upgrading from a previous release should
read it completely.


                      btree 1.0.2 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o <ansi.h> used for ANSI compatibility.

o Function prototype form used for function definitions if AC_PROTO
  defined.

o Fields can now be in any order and can overlap.

o Undefined bt_fltocr macro in btfix replaced with code.

o Modified flag check removed from btopen.

o btlock and btopen fixed to work on systems with mandatory file
  locking.

o DOS library names changed to more customary form where memory model
  is first character rather than last.


                      btree 1.0.1 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o AC_* macros (see blkio release notes) used in place of __STDC__ to
  detect ANSI compatibility.

o ~NULL replaced with (char *)NULL + 1 in btcursor macro because some
  compilers would not accept the ~ operator on NULL.

o btlock bug fixed.


                       btree 1.0 Release Notes
                       -----------------------
o The btree library has been enhanced to recognize fields. This has
  required changes in the btcreate and btopen parameter lists.  The
  original functions were




                                                     Citadel  91/09/23
     int btcreate(char *filename, size_t m, size_t keysize);
     int btopen(char *filename, char *type,
                int (*cmp)(const void *p1, const void *p2, size_t n));
  The new functions are

     int btcreate(char *filename, size_t m, size_t keysize,
                                int fldc, btfield_t btfldv[]);
     int btopen(char *filename, char *type,
                                int fldc, btfield_t btfldv[]);

o btdelete and btdelcur set the cursor to null.

o btlock sets the cursor to null when unlocking.

o errno macro BTEDUPKEY shortened to BTEDUP

o The btree node links are of type bpos_t, and so changing bpos_t also
  changed these links.  See the blkio release notes for explanation of
  the effects of this change.

o btkeycmp added to compare btree keys.

o The btfix function has been added to fix corrupt btree files.  This has
  required a slight change in the btree file format.

o function prototypes used if __STDC__ == 1

o const used if __STDC__ == 1

o -A compiler option used in Turbo C installation batch file to set
  __STDC__ to 1.
