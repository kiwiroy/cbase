                     manx GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Copyright (c) 1989 Citadel.

The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, this general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share manx.  To make sure that
you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of manx, that you receive source code, and that you know
you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of manx, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive the source code.
And you must tell them their rights.  Also, for our own protection, we
must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty
for manx.

Therefore Citadel makes the following terms which say what you must do
to be allowed to distribute manx.


                           COPYING POLICIES

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of manx as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that no files (including this License
   Agreement) are omitted or modified.

2. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer manx except
   as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer manx is void
   and your rights to use manx under this License Agreement shall be
   automatically terminated.

Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome.  Please contact Citadel, 241 East Eleventh
Street, Brookville, IN 47012.


                              DISCLAIMER

BECAUSE MANX IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO
WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, CITADEL AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE
MANX "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD
THE MANX PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL CITADEL AND/OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE MANX AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES,
OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED
BY CITADEL) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.
