                      -------------------------
o <ansi.h> used for ANSI compatibility

o Function prototype form used for function definitions if AC_PROTO
  defined.

o Import functions modified to accept blank fields for numeric types.
  Blank numeric fields are now interpreted as 0.

o consts removed from cbimp.

o cbexp fixed to not print extra trailing field delimiter.

o Bug importing escape sequence \nnn for t_char and t_uchar fixed.

o Bug detecting eof in cbimport fixed.

o Bug detecting corrupt database on open fixed.

o cbmkndx and cbrmndx functions added.

o nelems macro added.

o SINGLE_USER macro added.

o DOS file locking added.

o DOS library names changed to more customary form where memory model
  is first character rather than last.

o Batch files for Borland C++ and Microsoft C added.


                      cbase 1.0.1 Release Notes
                      -------------------------
o AC_* macros (see blkio release notes) used in place of __STDC__ to
  detect ANSI compatibility.

o t_cistring (case-insensitive string) data type added.

                                                     Citadel  91/09/23
o cbimport has been modified to continue importing records following
  the encounter of a record with an illegal duplicate key.
o cblock fixed to unlock data and key files in reverse order.

o Locking bug fixed in btree and blkio.


                       cbase 1.0 Release Notes
                       -----------------------
o The parameter list of the cbcreate and cbopen functions have been
  modified.  The original functions were

     int cbcreate(char *cbname, size_t recsize,
                              cbfield_t fields[], size_t fldcnt);
     int cbopen(char *cbname, char *type,
                              cbfield_t fields[], size_t fldcnt);

  The new functions are

     int cbcreate(char *cbname, size_t recsize,
                              int fldc, cbfield_t fldv[]);
     int cbopen(char *cbname, char *type,
                              int fldc, cbfield_t fldv[]);

o The cbfield_t bit flags CBFKEY and CBFUNIQ have been changed to
  CB_FKEY and CB_FUNIQ.



o All key cursors are positioned to null when a record is deleted.

o Field numbering now begins at zero.

o Because of an enhancement made to the btree library, it is no longer
  necessary to include the record position in the data type comparison
  functions when defining new data types.

o The functions cbimport and cbexport have been added to import and
  export data to printable files.  When adding a new data type,
  an import function and an export function must be provided in
  addition to the comparison function.

o There is no longer a maximum number of cbase fields.  The fldv array
  is now dynamically allocated when a cbase is opened.

o cbclose bug fixed.  Would not close first key file.

o function prototypes used if __STDC__ == 1.

o const used if __STDC__ == 1.

                                                     Citadel  91/09/23
o long double data types (t_ldouble, t_ldoublev) enabled if __STDC__
  == 1.

o cblock sets the cursors to null when unlocking.



o A pair of functions for converting names between the formats
  last-name-first and first-name-first has been provided.  fmltolfm
  and lfmtofml are located in the file fml.c in the example program
  directory.

o -A compiler option used in Turbo C installation batch file to set
  __STDC__ to 1.

o In the blkio library, bpos_t has been changed from size_t to
   unsigned long.  See the blkio library release notes for explanation
   of the effects of this change.
